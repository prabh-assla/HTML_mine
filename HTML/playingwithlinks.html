		The Internet is a computerized network of information. It is a system of interconnection of computer networks that link several billions of devices. The global system of interconnected computer networks, popularly known as, the internet brings the internet protocol suite, that is, TCP/IP into use to communicate between networks and devices. This network consists of private, academic, public, government and business networks that range from local scope to global scope linked by technologies including wireless, electronic and optical networking. There is a broad range of information resources and services on the internet. These resources include the world wide web (www), telephony, electronic mails, file sharing, and interlinked hypertext documents. The widespread usage of the internet in all corners of the world has made our lives more convenient as compared to the times when there was no internet. Earlier, people used to stand in long queues for any of their work whether it was to send letters to their loved ones, book movie tickets, train tickets, flight tickets, or for bank-related work like withdrawing money and depositing money. Now, all this work can be done over the internet without the need to stand in queues and wait. Emails and chat applications have completely stopped the trend of sending letters. Booking tickets for any purpose is now easily done from the comfort of home using a mobile phone or laptop. Also, net banking and phone banking services have minimized the need for a person to go to the bank for any purpose. Surely, the internet has made lives much easier than they otherwise were.
